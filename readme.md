[Progressive Web App (PWA) module](https://www.drupal.org/project/pwa)
integration for [Omnipedia](https://omnipedia.app/). Note that this built on
[the work-in-progress PWA 2.x
branch](https://www.drupal.org/project/pwa/issues/3165795) and will likely not
work with the 8.x-1.x version.

# Why open source?

We're dismayed by how much knowledge and technology is kept under lock and key
in the videogame industry, with years of work often never seeing the light of
day when projects are cancelled. We've gotten to where we are by building upon
the work of countless others, and we want to keep that going. We hope that some
part of this codebase is useful or will inspire someone out there.
